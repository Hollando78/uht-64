      "Physical object": "An oak tree occupies space and has a tangible, measurable physical presence — it is not conceptual or virtual.",
      "Man-made / synthetic": "It is a natural organism, not designed, fabricated, or constructed by humans.",
      "Biological or biologically-inspired": "It is a naturally occurring organism, governed by biological processes like growth, respiration, and reproduction.",
      "Fixed/static": "Though it changes over time, it is rooted in one place and does not locomote or change spatial position.",
      "Structural": "Its form supports weight, organizes internal components (e.g., trunk, branches), and serves as a scaffold for other entities (e.g., nests, vines).",
      "Perceptible": "It can be seen, touched, smelled, and heard (e.g., rustling), making it directly accessible to the senses.",
      "Material form": "Composed of organic matter — wood, bark, leaves — its identity is inseparable from its physical substance.",
      "Passive": "It does not act with intent; its behaviors arise from internal biology and environmental response without agency.",
      "Purposeful / intentional": "It does not have agency, goals, or designed intent — it acts only as biology dictates.",
      "Emits output / produces effect": "It affects its surroundings through byproducts and interactions — e.g., releasing oxygen, shedding leaves, casting shade.",
      "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "It does not handle logic, information, or signal processing — no circuitry or symbolic control.",
      "Transforms or modifies internal state": "It changes as it grows, responds to seasons, stores nutrients, and heals after damage.",
      "Interacts with humans directly": "It does not actively engage or interface with humans — any interaction is incidental or passive.",
      "Part of a larger system": "It is embedded within ecological networks — interacting with soil, water, fungi, insects, and climate in mutual dependence.",
      "Autonomous in function": "Although self-regulating biologically, it does not meet the threshold for functional autonomy (no goal-seeking behavior or system independence).",
      "System-critical": "Most oak trees are not keystone entities whose absence would collapse a system — they are contributive but not singularly essential.",
      "Symbolic / representational": "In this generic instance, 'Oak Tree' has no embedded symbolic role — symbolic meaning would require cultural framing or narrative context.",
      "Communicative": "It does not encode or transmit intentional signals or messages.",
      "Logical / rule-based": "It does not embody or operate on formal rules or systems of logic.",
      "Hierarchical / modular": "While it has parts, it is not a modular or explicitly hierarchical system in a designed or conceptual sense.",
      "Behavior-guiding": "It does not influence behavior via intention, symbolism, or instruction.",
      "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "It does not represent itself, reflect on its nature, or express meta-level ideas.",
      "Temporal": "Excluded in this encoding due to lack of semantic emphasis in the name or framing; while trees change over time, this version omits it absent explicit focus on seasonality or lifecycle.",
      "Contextual abstraction": "Its meaning does not shift across contexts or require interpretive abstraction — it is a concrete biological entity.",
      "Socially / culturally constructed": "Its identity as an oak tree is based in biology, not social agreement or cultural fabrication.",
      "Defined by a group/system": "It is not defined or regulated by a group, institution, or classification system (beyond biological taxonomy, which is not identity-defining here).",
      "Linked to identity or role": "It does not signify a social role, profession, or identity-bearing function.",
      "Regulated / governed": "It is not subject to institutional rules or governance.",
      "Teachable / transmissible": "The object itself is not knowledge-bearing or educational in form — it can be studied, but it does not teach.",
      "Visible": "Subsumed under 'Perceptible' and excluded here for compression — perceptibility already covers visual salience.",
      "Context-sensitive": "Excluded under the minimalist rule — while oaks respond to environment, this version does not emphasize context-specific traits or dependencies.",
      "Widely known": "The label 'Oak Tree' does not indicate symbolic fame, widespread cultural meaning, or iconic recognition — so this is omitted in the absence of framing to support it."
